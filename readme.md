Adds the ability to close and save mutliples tab at once.

The idea of this extension comes from one of my favourites Firefox add-ons by piro http://piro.sakura.ne.jp/xul/_multipletab.html.en

Usage is very simple, you just click and hold your mouse a little bit, the selection of tabs will starts after 200ms. You just move your mouse hover the tabs you want to select and when you just release the click a popup with options will appear.
